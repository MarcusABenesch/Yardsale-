# Buisness Partners
Our main buisness partners are ones that we feel can not just be a source for capital, but ones that also can both buisness grwo and suceed. Our first buisness partner is UPS. UPS can not just add capital, but they can help us be our exclusive shipping partner. We will make them the only in-app option for shipping, and in return they can cut us a percentage of their profits that they recive from Yardsale's customers. Our other buisness partner is Google. We can use Google's search algorithm for letting people search through all of the deals on Yardsale and it will give them the most accurate results possible. Yardsale can also help Google by sharing some of our customers data so that they can see what our customers are searching for and use that data to make more targeted advertisements.
