Ian Love - (Leader) Customer Service/Quality Assurance 
<<A key resource for our business>>
In the operation of Yardsale, what we have to do is prepare and operate the server.
We are going to use a cloud server.
For cloud server services offered by Google and Amazon, developers do not need advanced server operation capabilities.
We can concentrate solely on the planning and development of better services.
For image processing, OpenCV performs advanced analysis, accurately analyzing user's preferences and providing value not found in other market applications.
In data analysis, we will acquire finer and more accurate information by collaborating with cloud server service and reflect it to users' recommendation.
# Key Activities
By developing the platform with the idea of creating a virtual yardsale we will be advertising to websites like youtube to notify consumers about our yardsale business.
Our online business will also have people to help consumers with any confusions or issue with our platform so that we our maintenance team could fix it.
Our products will be physical with the goal of our consumers purchases to arrive on schedule with data on the products location.
