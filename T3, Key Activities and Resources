# A key resource for our business
In the operation of Yardsale, what we have to do is prepare and operate the server.
We are going to use a cloud server.
For cloud server services offered by Google and Amazon, developers do not need advanced server operation capabilities.
We can concentrate solely on the planning and development of better services.
For image processing, OpenCV performs advanced analysis, accurately analyzing user's preferences and providing value not found in other market applications.
In data analysis, we will acquire finer and more accurate information by collaborating with cloud server service and reflect it to users' recommendation.
# Key Activities
By developing the platform with the idea of creating a virtual yardsale we will be advertising to websites like youtube to notify consumers about our yardsale business.
Our online business will also have people to help consumers with any confusions or issue with our platform so that we our maintenance team could fix it.
Our products will be physical with the goal of our consumers purchases to arrive on schedule with data on the products location.
#Key Resources
As a startup we would probably seek investors as well as take loans from the Bank to get our company off the ground. With this money we can set up an office to lease. The aquisstion of furniture aswell as computers and other office neccessities will also be taken into account. Initially we will start minimally staffed but as our company grows we will hire more and more people. Specfically we need namely programmers, other departments of our company may be overseen by a max of 5 indviduals with the rest of employees being programmers for our online and mobile platform. To keep our platform safe we should also aquire a Software Patent. While most of our resoruces will not be owned intially we will work towards full ownership.
